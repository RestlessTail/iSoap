\title{Optimize Cluster Resolution for Enhanced Cell Type Identification}
\usage{
optimize.loose(obj, markers, itr = 5, resolution = c(0.001, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{Seurat} object.}

\item{markers}{A data frame specifying marker genes and their corresponding
cell types. It should have at least two columns: `markers` (gene names) and `type`
(cell type labels).}

\item{itr}{The number of iterations for the optimization algorithm. Higher values may
improve the accuracy but increase runtime.}

\item{resolution}{A numeric vector of length 2, defining the initial minimum and maximum
resolution values to consider during optimization. Note that the actual optimization
process may extend beyond this range.}
}
\value{
A list containing the optimized clustering resolution, the evaluation value,
  and the mapping of clusters to cell types.
}
\description{
`optimize.loose` automatically adjusts the resolution parameter within a Seurat object's
single-cell RNA-seq data to achieve more precise matching of cell types, especially for
rare and difficult-to-detect populations. This function employs an optimization strategy
that may extend beyond the initially specified resolution range to find the optimal
clustering configuration.
